This game is as the name said crown city ar is the AR(arugement reality) version of this game.I used basic unity ARfoundation and google Arcore services to implement this game.
This game is mutliplayer upto 6 more players but for testing , I only allowed 2 players to play at a time. I used Photon services for multiplayer.
The basic concept of this game is within 2min, the player with highest crowd will win, player can kill other players who are having less crowd or get killed by a player with higher crowd.
I believe, This project is quite complex as Multiplayer AR game are quite hard to make and there are alot of things we have to keep in mind inorder to make a project working likw location in real world etc.
